universal_execute_description = """
universal_execute(qasm: str, n: int) -> winner_state: str

Purpose:
  Execute a GHZ-state circuit given in OpenQASM 3.0, measure all n qubits,
  and return the bitstring with the highest observed probability along with
  its empirical probability.

Inputs:
  - qasm: str
      OpenQASM 3.0 source that prepares an n-qubit GHZ state (or any n-qubit
      state youâ€™d like to sample). The code must operate on exactly n qubits.
      It does NOT need to include measurements; this function will add them.
  - n: int
      Number of qubits (and measured bits). Must satisfy n >= 1.

Behavior:
  1) Parses the QASM and verifies the circuit uses exactly n qubits.
  2) Builds a measurement wrapper that measures all n qubits into n classical bits.
  3) Runs the wrapped circuit on AerSimulator for 'shots' shots.
  4) Finds the bitstring with the largest count and returns it and its
     empirical probability (count/shots).

Output:
  - winner_state: str
      The most frequent n-bit measurement string (MSB-left as returned by Qiskit, e.g., '000...0' or '111...1' for GHZ).

Raises:
  - ValueError on invalid inputs or qubit-count mismatch.
  - Qiskit parsing/simulation exceptions are propagated with context.
