Prepare an entangled cluster state on an n-qubit register. In total, the circuit uses n qubits. The input should be in the quantum register 'q', initially all qubits are set to the |0⟩ state. The output is stored in the same register 'q', where each qubit is first rotated into the |+⟩ state using a Hadamard gate, and then controlled-Z gates are applied between every pair of neighboring qubits to generate the linear cluster state.Please write down the qasm code when qubit number n=6
