Perform a cyclic shift of all qubits by one position. For an n-qubit register, qubit q[i] is mapped to q[(i+1) mod n]. In total, the circuit uses n qubits. The input should be stored in quantum register 'q', and after applying the gate, the state is permuted so that each qubitâ€™s value is shifted forward by one position, with the last qubit wrapping around into position 0. Please give me the qasm code when n=6.
